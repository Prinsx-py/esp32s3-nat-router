# esp32s3-nat-router
ESP32S3 WiFi NAT Router with client listing, serial deauth, and network monitoring

# My Goal:
1. To make a NAT Router for ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1
2. Deauth users via serial monitor
3. Forward traffic from Upstream network
4. List all connected devices
5. Customizable STA List (if you have multiple network to choose from and if the esp32s3 either gets kicked, disconnected, blacklisted, or the network is unavailable, it would connect to a different netowrk from your list)
6. Customizeable AP SSID and password
7. Customize all via Serial Monitor
8. And lastly, make this whole project entirely only in GitHub and not using ESP-IDF, esptool, PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, and other tools except for GitHub


Everything will be made by a single STE Student from GEANHS from Philippines
